## How are health metrics used to assess and compare projects? 

1. To what extent are you focused on understanding who your contributors are and what engages them?
2. How would you describe the “relationship ecosystem” that’s at play when you are looking at projects you are involved with? 
3. Do you think about contributors in your organization differently than contributors from outside your your organization? 
4. What are the different “kinds” of relationships you have with people from different projects? Or, more aptly, do you have direct relationships with people or software mediated relationships?
5. What important questions can you answer about your project(s)? (What do you know?)
6. What questions do you have about your project(s) that you don’t have answers to but would like?  
7. How do you know your project(s) is good? How do you define “good”?
8. What is the alignment between your organizations strategic objectives and the portfolio of projects you’re concerned with?
9. Is what you consider a “good” project the same as what others in your project’s group consider a “good” project?
10. Are there other projects or multiple projects you seek for guidance with your project? Could you give me an example?
11. When comparing your projects, what factors help you determine if the comparison is relevant?
12. In what areas could another project influence your decisions? Do you use information about other projects to make decisions about project engagement?
13. What factors can determine if a proposed change makes it into the project?

Take a moment and think about potential Use Cases for community health metrics. These can be use cases that you have successfully used prior or even use cases that you believe would be helpful in the future.
