* For information on where these terms were identified and how it relates to social comparison see the following sections

Festinger Hypothesis I -
“There exists in the human organism, a drive to evaluate his opinions and abilities”

•	Open source participants want health metrics to evaluate their projects. 

Nodes: 
A-IA (Need to Evaluate) - Why Is measuring project health important?


Festinger Hypothesis II –
“To the extent that objective, non-social means are not available, people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison respectively with the opinions and abilities of others”

•	Open source participants compare their projects to other projects to evaluate health

CII-A “In the absence of both a physical or a social comparison, evaluations of opinions and abilities are unstable ”

•	Open source participants may not understand the health of their projects if they are not using social comparison.

CII-B “When an objective , non-social basis for the evaluation of one’s ability or opinion is readily available persons will not evaluate their opinions or abilities by comparison with others”

•	Open source projects that have clear goals and unique processes may not need to evaluate their health with other projects.

Understanding – understanding of health

Goals – project goals

Unique – project uniqueness


Festinger Hypothesis III –
“The tendency to compare oneself with some other specific person decreases as the difference between his opinion or ability and one’s own increases.”

•	Open source participants may be reluctant to use social comparison when the projects are different than theirs.

CIII-A “Given a range of possible persons for comparison, someone close to one’s own ability or opinion will be chosen for comparison.”

•	Open source participants will attempt to compare their projects with projects that they think are similar.

“Subjective evaluations of opinions or of abilities are stable when comparison is available with others who are judged to be close to one’s opinion or abilities”

“The availability of comparison with others whose opinions or abilities are somewhat different from one’s own will produce tendencies to change ones’ evaluation of the opinion or ability in question” 

“A person will be less attracted to situations where others are very divergent from him than to situations where others are close to him for both abilities and opinions”

K-SC (Comparison Relevance) - How relevant are comparisons?

Similar – projects are similar

Different – projects are different

Engagement – Choose to engage with a project

“The existence of a discrepancy in a group with respect to opinion or abilities will lead to action on the part of members of that group to reduce discrepancy”

L-SC (Decisions) - How is social comparison used  to make decisions?


Festinger Hypothesis IV –
“There is a unidirectional drive upward in the case of abilities which is largely absent in opinions”

Open source participants do not use social comparison for a competitive understanding of health in open source ecosystems

Competitive – comparing multiple projects for competitive purposes

Ecosystems – multiple projects and how they relate

Festinger Hypothesis V –

“There are non-social restraints which make it difficult or even impossible to change one’s ability. These non-social restraints are largely absent in opinions”

Open source participants views on health are malleable however changing a project to reflect these views may be difficult

Change – changing a project due to health

L-SC (Decisions) - How is social comparison used  to make decisions?

Festinger Hypothesis VI –
“The cessation of comparison with others is accompanied by hostility or derogation to the extent that continued comparison with those persons implies unpleasant consequences”

Open source participants may disagree or have negative opinions of projects where comparison is not or no longer relevant

CVI-A “Cessation of comparison with others will be accompanied by hostility or derogation in the case of opinion. In the case of abilities, this will not generally be true” 

Festinger Hypothesis VII –
“Any factors which increase the importance of some particular group as a comparison group for some particular opinion or ability will increase the pressure toward uniformity concerning that ability or opinion within that group”

As relevance of comparison increases so does the likelihood of open source participants adopting standards or uniform process across projects


“When a discrepancy exists with respect to opinions or abilities there will be tendencies to change one’s own position so as to move closer to others group”

“When a discrepancy exists with respect to opinions or abilities there will be tendencies to change others in the group to bring them closer to oneself”

“When a discrepancy exists with respect to opinions or abilities there will be tendencies to cease comparing oneself with those in the group who are very different from oneself”

“Any factors which increase the strength of the drive to evaluate some particular ability or opinion will increase the pressure toward uniformity”

“An increase in the importance of an ability or an opinion, or an increase in its relevance to immediate behavior, will increase the pressure toward reducing discrepancies concerning that opinion or ability”

Uniformity – Standards, conformity, universal


CVII-A “The stronger the attraction to the group the stronger will be the pressure towards uniformity concerning abilities and opinions within that group”

CVII-B “The greater the relevance of the opinion or ability to the group, the stronger will be the pressure toward uniformity concerning that opinion or ability.

Exemplars – using other projects as a guide

J-SC (Project Guidance) - How are other projects used as exemplars?

H-IA (Success) - How is project health understood across projects?

Festinger Hypothesis VIII –
“If persons who are very divergent from one’s own opinion or ability are perceived as different from oneself on attributes consistent with the divergence, the tendency to narrow the range of comparability becomes stronger”

If projects are different, there is a tendency by open source participant to narrow the focus of comparison 

Narrow focus – narrow focus of comparison 

Festinger Hypothesis IX -
“When there is a range of opinion or ability in a group or ability in a group, the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different from those who are close to the mode of the group than those who are distant from the mode. Specifically, those close to the mode of the group will have stronger tendencies to change positions of the others, relatively weaker tendencies to narrow the range of comparison and much weaker tendencies to change their own position compared to those who are distant from the mode of the group”

Internal – mode of participant central

External – mode of the participant on edge

H-SC (Shared Definition of Good) - Do project leaders have a shared understanding of Project Health?
