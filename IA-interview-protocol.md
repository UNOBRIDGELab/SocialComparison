## What types of information is used in the design of OSS? 

This protocol explores context, knowledge, expertise, inspiration, and  information gathering (Eckert & Stacey, 2000) in the design of open source project health metrics.   

1. Why are you interested in community health metrics?  
2. Could you talk about some specific instances where you have used community health metrics in the past?  
3. Are you currently deploying any health metrics? If so, how are you applying health metrics?  
4. How similar are the health metrics discussions across open source communities that you are familiar with? What if anything, is missing from these community discussions?  
5. What would you like to see from the CHAOSS project?  
6. Who are the stakeholders of open source health metrics?   
7. When you look at contributions to the metrics conversation coming from different sources, what factors determine the quality of those contributions?  
8. How can we measure the success of health metrics across communities?  
9. Are there types of health metrics that you believe are universal across OSS communities?   
10. Do you have any concerns about the deployment of health metrics?  

### Individual Metrics
At this time, the CHAOSS project is exploring metrics related to Project Growth, Maturity, and Decline, Project Diversity and Inclusion, Risk, and Value.  

1. Of these categories, which one interests you the most? 
a. What are your thoughts on this metric category?  
b. What individual metrics could help in its representation?  
c. What could these metrics signal?  
d. How could these metrics be related to applied value (Use Case)?
